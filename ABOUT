== What is it
Set of tasks to use with Apache Ant to control VMWare VMs via VIX API.

== License
Library is licensed under GNU LGPLv3. You are free to use it under the terms of this license.
If you are sure that you need a special exception and you are able to explain why you think so, please contact me (see later).

== Contributions
I will be pleased to accept any contibutions to this project.

What things would be nice to be done:
- new tasks; but please, use RAW api, not any object-oriented wrappers;
- VM APIs distinct from VIX API: I don't know whether I'll have time to meet VirtualBox COM API, or others; would be great if anyone can help
- documentation :) although I hope that I'll have time to write it myself

== The author
My name is Anton, and I am currently software tests developer. The idea behind this project has roots in our internal software currently developed by me.
But this project is a clean room rework of it, without our proprietary part, and without some initial design flaws, also. :)
